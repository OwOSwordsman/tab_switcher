# Tab Switcher
Effortlessly switch between your last two tabs.

## More Info and Caveats
This extension only keeps track of the last two tabs and will only switch between the two. Having multiple windows opened and switching between them may cause unexpected behavior.

## Installation
1. Download/clone this repository
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable developer mode
4. Press the `Load unpacked` button
5. Select the `src` folder from the repository you downloaded

## Post Installation
By default the keyboard shortcut is `Alt+Q` but it is objectively more convenient and natural for it to be `Ctrl+Tab`. To achieve this follow the [instructions on this page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ctrl%2Btab-mru/ialfjajikhdldpgcfglgndennidgkhik).
